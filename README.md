# Sanwad (संवाद) — Voice in. Text across. Voice out.

**Smart India Hackathon 2026 · Problem Statement 26173 · ISRO Space Applications Centre**

A fully offline, open-source **emergency walkie-talkie for Android** with local Speech-to-Text (STT) and Text-to-Speech (TTS) in **10 Indian languages** — built for the links where audio simply cannot fit.

> When the network dies, voice is the last link. Sanwad turns speech into ~100 bytes of text, streams it over Wi-Fi Direct / Bluetooth (and later LoRa / NavIC-ecosystem / HF-VHF packet links), and turns it back into speech on the other phone.

## Try the interactive prototype

Open [`prototype/index.html`](prototype/index.html) in any browser — no build step, no internet needed (single self-contained file).

**Demo flow (2 minutes):**

1. **Phone A** (left): Get started → allow permissions → enter a display name → pick a language
2. The two phones **link over Wi-Fi Direct** automatically
3. **Hold the mic** on Phone A and speak — Sanwad detects the pause, forms the sentence, and streams it as **~100 B of text** (watch the packet chip + packet log — *audio never crosses the link*)
4. **Phone B** receives it and **plays it as a voice note**
5. Tick **⚠ Send as alert** and talk again — Phone B announces it **at highest volume, non-interruptible**
6. Toggle **Walkie → Phone** to see "off = normal phone" (plain text messaging)
7. Tap **ⓘ** on either phone for the on-device architecture & latency budget

**Demo helpers**

- **"Demo: tap to talk"** checkbox on each phone — one tap sends (no need to hold). Ideal for live judge demos; off by default to show true push-to-talk.
- Deep links (open directly on a state): `index.html#shot=linked` · `#shot=voice` · `#shot=alert` · `#shot=phone` · `#demo` (auto-plays the loop after onboarding)

## How it maps to the problem statement

| PS requirement | Where it is |
|---|---|
| Lightweight, accurate STT + TTS for 10 Indian languages (hi, gu, mr, kn, ml, ta, te, or, bn, en), running locally | On-device STT/TTS; ⓘ sheet on each phone |
| STT detects pauses & stoppages, forms sentences | Hold-to-talk flow: "detecting pause" → "forming sentence" |
| Instantly stream via Wi-Fi/Bluetooth to embedded device or another phone, minimal latency | Wi-Fi Direct / BLE transport; packet log with byte counts; latency budget ≤ 4–5 s mouth-to-ear |
| TTS converts received text to intelligible speech, played as voice note | Phone B playback with play/progress controls |
| Alert messages at highest volume, non-interruptible | ⚠ alert flow — full-screen, mute bypassed |
| Two phones with same app, one TTS mode / one STT mode, push-to-talk walkie-talkie | The live loop in the prototype |
| Turned off = works like a phone | Walkie/Phone toggle |

## Architecture (as intended for the on-device build)

- **STT:** IndicConformer (AI4Bharat) — int8 TFLite, on-device, < 300 MB, 10 languages; Whisper.cpp as fallback
- **TTS:** espeak-ng baseline (all 10 languages, fully offline) + neural Piper (en/hi) for high-frequency alert phrases — speed + intelligibility prioritised over studio fidelity
- **Transport:** Wi-Fi Direct / BLE today; same text-first design ports to LoRa, NavIC-ecosystem messaging, HF/VHF packet without re-architecture
- **Efficiency targets:** 2 GB RAM footprint, ₹8–10k (Cortex-A53 class) devices, < 5% idle CPU, ₹0 recurring cloud/cellular cost
- **Latency budget:** STT 1.5–2.5 s · link < 0.5 s · TTS < 1.5 s → **≤ 4–5 s mouth-to-ear**, RTF < 0.5
- **Open source only** (Apache-2.0 / MIT), **100% offline**

## Honest note (prototype)

The in-browser prototype **simulates** STT/TTS and the phone-to-phone transport (with realistic ~0.5 s link delay). Where the browser supports it, **live Web Speech APIs are used automatically** — real microphone STT on the sender and real TTS voices on the receiver. All model names, footprints and latency figures on the ⓘ sheet reflect the intended on-device architecture.
